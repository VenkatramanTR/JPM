2. Solution

Architecture and Assumptions

* Java is used for providing the solution
* Spring coupled with Java is used for the solution as Spring provides many core features like MVC, AOP and IOC
* Maven is used for building and for providing JUNIT test cases for this application
* The application requirements are developed as services independent of each other, this will reduce the dependency
* As the application are writtern as individual service, it is very easy to develop REST resources out of the services
* We can write a simple consumer class and can access the REST resources
* Spring property configurator is used for the loading of the property file and the values are then injected into a Spring bean
* The Spring property bean is used for testing the applications.
* The application testing can be tweaked by updating the properties file and then re running the application
* Apache logging has been used for the logging purpose



How to run and test the application

* The application contains a StockApp standalone java program which runs the entire application and outputs all the data output as per the requirement
* Change the property file values as per the need and then run the StockApp java program


Resources provided

* Class diagram
* README file to know more about the application
* Java doc comments added which can be used to generate the java doc
